### API Documentation for Inference Code (Segmenter Backend) for HOPE-Segmenter-Kids

Welcome to the API documentation for the inference code, the segmenter backend for HOPE-Segmenter-Kids. Navigate through the table of contents on the left to explore detailed documentation for each submodule.

This project develops the **Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmenter**, a free, open-source web-based application
designed at [Children's National Hospital](https://www.childrensnational.org/) as part of the [HOPE platform](https://docs.hope4kids.io/HOPE-Platform/) 
for the segmentation and analysis of pediatric brain tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Developed in Python, this software aims to provide precise quantitative analysis 
of pediatric brain MRI, to support clinical decision-making in diagnosis and prognosis.  
The software and instruction are available at [segmenter.hope4kids.io](https://segmenter.hope4kids.io/) and [instructions](https://docs.hope4kids.io/HOPE-Segmenter-Kids/).
