The **CAVS-NF1: Central AI-enabled Volumetric Service for NF1** is a free, open-source web-based application designed at [Children's National Hospital](https://www.childrensnational.org/) 
for the segmentation and analysis of optic pathway gliomas associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1-OPG)  in  T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Developed in Python, this web tool aims to provide precise quantitative analysis of pediatric brain MRI, to support clinical decision-making in diagnosis and prognosis.  

With its user-friendly interface, **CAVS-NF1** provides automated segmentation and volumetric measurements within 2 minutes after uploading the t1 MRI sequences. This software offers **state-of-the-art performance** powered by our benchmarked segmentation model.  

# Usage

This software requires T1 MRI sequences: native pre-contrast T1-weighted (t1n) or 
contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (t1c). The MRI sequences should be 
uploaded in NIfTI format (*i.e.*, **.nii.gz**). Before uploading, 
we strongly recommend performing **de-identification** to remove any protected 
health information, including **defacing** if necessary. 

<!-- **Pre-processing** in the Segmenter is under development. At this time, 
we expect users to follow the standardized ["BraTS Pipeline"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15009) 
pre-processing, which includes co-registration of four sequences, and resampling to isotropic 1 mm resolution.  
Public tools such as the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit ([CaPTk](https://github.com/CBICA/CaPTk)) 
and Federated Tumor Segmentation ([FeTS](https://fets-ai.github.io/Front-End/process_data)) 
toolkits can be used for this purpose.   -->

Once the MRI sequences are uploaded, simply click check the box and push the **Start Segmentation** button to generate segmentation and volumetric measurements in the **Status** box. The process typically takes around 1 minute. Afterward, you can visualize both the image and the segmentation in axial, coronal, and sagittal views using the interactive **Sliders**. Segmentation results can be downloaded in NIfTI format by clicking the **Download Segmentation File** button.  

For **demonstration** purposes, we provide sample cases at the bottom of the page. 
Select one and click the **Start Segmentation** button to see how the software works.
